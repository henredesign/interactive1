Don’t pass up the invitation to an office party; not attending could hurt your reputation. And when you attend, do spend at least 30 minutes at the party for appearances. But don’t overstay your welcome by partying until the wee hours.

To facilitate sleight of hand, a special manner of holding the cards is often used called the Mechanic’s Grip. The best way to understand the Mechanic’s Grip is to hold a deck as though you were preparing to deal. Most likely the deck is in the palm of your hand with your four fingers along the long side of the deck and your thumb on the top. When you deal, you use your thumb to push a single card onto the tips of your fingers. Move you index and middle finger to the short side of the deck away from yourself. This is basically the Mechanic’s Grip. Remember just because someone is holding the deck in this fashion doesn’t mean they’re cheating. <p></div>

We begin to question if God is real and if He cares about us. I want to encourage you with the truth that our Creator and Sustainer is working in and through you while you go through struggles! When you feel your faith is fading, read these Scriptures for guidance, support and reassurance that there is hope. Whether you need faith for healing, an unanswered prayer, or faith to persevere, our God is waiting and ready to give us His supernatural strength. Here is a list of verses I have found to provide increased faith. You can also use the prayer below for inspiration when talking to God.<p></div>

Stop using cliché inspirational quotes. Certain pieces of advice or nuggets of "wisdom" have officially been overused and they weren't even that great to begin with!

"But they are cliché for a reason! It's because they are all true!"

Stop. There are so many clever and inspiring ways to tell someone to follow their dreams or believe in love. <p></div>

That being said, mastering a few fundamentals will help you perfect your technique. From here, we encourage you to experiment with different roasts, origins, or preparation methods. Here are our tips to brew a classic cup of coffee. Make sure that your tools — from bean grinders and filters to coffee makers— are thoroughly cleaned after each use. Rinse with clear, hot water (or wipe down thoroughly), and dry with an absorbent towel. It’s important to check that no grounds have been left to collect and that there’s no build-up of coffee oil (caffeol), which can make future cups of coffee taste bitter and rancid.

Compiled into a 360-degree video of 100 Vines playing at once, and they become a vision of eternal torment.

Vine compilation videos are nothing new—a search of the term returns more than three million results on YouTube—but this is something else. This is the bad place.

YouTuber Jake Hall created a video that sends the unlucky viewer spelunking down a K-hole of screaming memes. Look down, and it’s an endless abyss of six-second jokes. Look up, and realize there is no escape. It’s the Architect scene from The Matrix but with teenagers doing pratfalls and blowing their iPhone speakers out in a deafening chorus.

It can reach well over a foot in diameter, more than sturdy enough to swing on. However, you can see where other problems might intrude — e.g., how you’d get a grip. The more you investigate, in fact, the more you realize vines wouldn’t make for a practical system of locomotion. Investigate further still and you come to an additional conclusion: Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs didn’t think they would either.<p></div>

A drought in the West? No problem, we'll just order a few gentle showers. A hurricane threatening the East Coast? Just stay calm, folks, we'll launch a small nuke to blast the storm apart.

They say truth is stranger than fiction, and such is the case with humans attempting to control the weather. Let's start with a brief history. Numerous Native American tribes, especially those living in semiarid desert country, such as the Pueblo, Hopi and Zuni, engaged in elaborate dances to coax moisture from the rain-stingy skies.

We produce it just by breathing. But combustion – from fuel or friction – leaves darker traces. Once a point of contention, manmade climate change is now scientific fact. More than 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that changes to the global climate in the last century have been caused by anthropogenic activity.

The so-called ‘Consensus on consensus’ has drawn more attention to an issue that, since the start of this century, has divided many. But the evidence is overwhelming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have been exorbitant, leading to the phenomenon that, until relatively recently, has been known by the misnomer ‘global warming’.<p></div>

Buying the land with a land loan first allows you to take the land off the market so others cannot buy it before you do.
